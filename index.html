				<p>This secluded, lakefront getaway is on beautiful Green Lake in Interlochen, Michigan. The lodge is nestled on a ten-acre parcel with 450 feet of private lake frontage. The large patio is perched upon a blackberry bluff with tranquil views of the lake and surrounding forest. Charming nature paths meander through the trees and open to a lakefront picnic table, sitting area and fire pit. The waterfront is equipped with a paddleboat, two kayaks and canoe for your use. (Dock, boat hoist, and nearby launch are also available.)</p>
				<p>Built in 2006, this pine-paneled lodge very comfortably sleeps nine. Two bedrooms on the main floor each have a full-size bed. In addition, one of these bedrooms has a lofted twin bed. The dormitory upstairs includes one full-size bed, two twin beds and a private bathroom. Blackberry Bluff is located 15 miles southwest of Traverse City, across Green Lake from the Interlochen Arts Academy. Attractions within a short drive include Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Leland's historic Fishtown, wineries, and numerous bike and hiking trails. (Click <a href="amenities.html">here</a> for details and more attractions.)</p>
				<p>The village of Interlochen, with grocery stores, restaurants, miniature golf, ice cream and quaint shops, is a convenient three miles away.</p>
				<p>A week at Blackberry Bluff is the perfect, relaxing, getaway for your family. Paddle, swim and fish in a large, protected cove on Green Lake.</p>
				<p>Escape to your private nature retreat and discover the plentiful wildlife viewing opportunities. Listen to the loon calls as you watch the sun rise over Green Lake. (Click <a href="photos.html">here</a> for more photos.)</p>
